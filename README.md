# Bootcamp Project Backend - Todo List App
In this project, we're going to be building a small web-app that keeps track of tasks for a TODO list.
We're going to allow the user to create multiple seperate lists (which we call task lists), to stay organized.
The backend project will provide an API that will be consumed by the frontend.

Users of our app will be able to:
 - Log in and out
 - Create, manage, and delete their task lists
 - Add, edit, and remove tasks from their task lists
 - Mark tasks as completed
 - Add tags to tasks and task lists

For each task, we'll be keeping track of when it was created, and if and when it was marked completed.
The authentication mechanism (logging in and out) is already provided for you.
Tags are also already provided for you, but you'll need to implement the mechanism to attach them to other objects.

## Bootcamp Chapters
The bootcamp project consists of several chapters. They should be completed in order, as many of the later chapters
will rely on code you write in the earlier ones.

## Bonus - User Sign Up
As an optional bonus, use what you've learned to implement a User sign-up flow.
You can also allow Users to edit their profile.
